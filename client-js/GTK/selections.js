/**
 * selections - Classes for managing Genome Selections
 * 
 * A key feature of the 4D Genome Browser is Selections: A subset of the entire gene sequence
 * selected by the user. A selection comprises one or more continous regions of base pairs
 * along the sequence, and can be represented in any of three units:
 * 
 *      - "Locations": The indices of individual base pairs making up the selection.
 *      - "Segments":  The indices of segments (sets of base pairs) making up the selection.
 *      - "Genes":     The names of genes contained within the selection
 * 
 * Locations and Segments are usually simple functions of one another since there is a constant
 * (per project) value representing how many locations there are per segment. For example, if there
 * are 1,000 base pairs in each segment, then a selection with locations 4000-6000 can be
 * represented as segments 4-6. Representation as Genes is more complicated since the definitions
 * of which genes map to which base pairs are stored server-side, so resolving the genes
 * a selection is made from requires an async fetch.
 * 
 * Of course, mapping between these units isn't always one-to-one. Segment or Gene values may
 * represent a slightly different selection than what's defined by the locatation values, as
 * segments will always be represented as whole numbers and genes are considered "selected" even if
 * only part of them is in the selected range.
 * 
 * This file/module defines a few classes and objects for dealing with selections:
 * 
 *      - UNIT: An enum describing the different unit types: LOCATION, SEGMENT, GENE.
 * 
 *      - Selection: An immutable object representing a selection. A selection can be constructed
 *                   by specifying any of the three units mentioned above. Once constructed, there
 *                   are methods to get the selection described in any of the three units.
 *
